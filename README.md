Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description

This project is a payroll where the manager can view and manage a payroll data from the employees. We had a starter code with the html and css structure already done, and in the javascript there was some already done and we had to add command to make it completely useful. On this project I had some trouble with function in Javascript, I had to watch videos to actually understand it; another problem was with some functions that we didnt really go deep in class like the isNaN  and Math.floor. 


## Usage

This project is really early to use, when you see the website there is a button where you click and it will appear a prompt window to you add the First Name, Last Name and salary. if you cancel the window after you add the salary, the data you added will show up as a table with all the datas, and if you open the console log you will be able to see the average salary and a random employee choose.
